# next-gen_openreport
This is an open source python initiative to use form k-10 and other financial reports required by US companies that may be manipulated.

The idea is, instead of loking at company parameters one by one from the USA filtering the important data and the unimportant data, why not have a tool that gets big data and converts it to readable statistics?
